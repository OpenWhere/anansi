This is a step-by-step example of iterating with this Iterator. The example graph is below, child order is alphabetic.

          A
         / \
        B   C
       / \ / \
      E   D   F

The iteration order will be (walks from A to):
  D, E, B, D, F, C, A

The state of the Iterator is the state of its move stack, which will be written as:

              move.vertex  move.iterator
  bottom      A            [ B, * C ]
              B            [ D, E * ]
  top         E            [ ]

Or as just "empty" if there are no moves in the stack. The "*" in the iterator precedes the next vertex to be returned.

In the step-by-step below, colloquial language will be used (push, pop, top) rather than the actual method names.

"advance top and push next" means:
  vertex = top.iterator.next()
  push [ vertex, children(vertex).iterator() ]
So, advance the top iterator and push a move for its children.
